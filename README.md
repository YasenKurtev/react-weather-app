Install all dependencies with `npm install`

The app uses OpenWeatherMap and Mapbox. In order to start the project, you are going to need access keys for both.<br/>
You can create an account and get your key here:<br/>
<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">OpenWeatherMap</a><br/>
<a href="https://openweathermap.org/">Mapbox</a>

Create a file called .env in the root directory of the project and add the following code in the file:
```
REACT_APP_API_KEY_APPID='your-OpenWeatherMap-key'

REACT_APP_MAP_KEY_APPID='your-Mapbox-key'
```
